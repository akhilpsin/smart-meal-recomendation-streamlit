To generate the sample dataset, run:

```bash
python Generate_SampleRestaurantData.py
```

This will create the `germany_restaurant_data_3000.csv` file in the `data` directory.

## File Structure

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application script.
- `backend.py`: Contains functions for managing user data and interacting with the meal dataset.
- `Generate_SampleRestaurantData.py`: Script to generate the sample restaurant data.
